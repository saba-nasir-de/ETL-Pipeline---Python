# ETL-Pipeline---Python
Its a an ETL pipeline build using python language. The Relational database used here is MySQL. The mproject provides a template for creating an ETL pipeline. This project can be customised to your own business case scenerios. I have passed a sample data set through the ETL pipeline to show case how this template can be used.
